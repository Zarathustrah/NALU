    description: 'Unstad beach is facing north-west while the predominately wind and waves are W/SW, which gives the place mostly offshore winds. The lack of daylight during winter months in November to February make this place a challenging surf destination. The flip-side being almost continuous light throughout the summer. From mid April to late August you could surf 24/7. Unstad has a lot to offer for surfers at any level, all year around.'

    description: 'Impossibles is a temperamental reef break that comes alive when powerful S/SW swells hit the south coast of Bali and meet gentle SE trade winds. The left-hand wave breaks between Padang Padang and Bingin and offers a fast barreling wave that peels down the line for up to 450 yards, in special occasions.'

    description: 'La Palue is the most well-know surf spot in Crozon, if not of Brittany. It catches the most swell. La Palue is a long, west facing stretch of beach. It’s a cobble/sand bottom floor that gradually descends into the Atlantic. Why is that important? Because it’s one of the few Breton beaches that is surfable at all tides. High tide is certainly best: it pushes the waves onto the inner banks and produces nice A-frame waves.'

    description: 'Puerto Sandino is one of the longest waves in Nicaragua, but it can be difficult to catch it good, as it is openly exposed to the wind and way out there off shore. The initial take off zone to the end of the wave usually averages over 300 yards when its on. It is mostly a sand bottom break, however there are reef sections at certain points along this long wave. These intermittent areas of sand and reef allow for a variety of barrel and wally sections for the length of the ride. Boat access is recommended, as the wave starts in front of a large river mouth roughly almost a half mile from the shore.'

    description: 'The hub of surfing is Long Beach, arguably the best and most consistent entry-level surf spot on the Atlantic coast of the Peninsula and a favourite contest venue with its convenient carpark and ablution facilities. Outside the tidal pool is a classic reef and point-break setup that starts 200 metres off the rocks and beyond the kelp-beds with the “Outer Kom”, a powerful left-breaking reef featuring an adrenaline generating, hollow takeoff and long walls when the waves are between 1.5 and 4 metres.'

    description: 'Today, the lighthouse is long gone, but those stone jetties combined with the beach location just north of Cape Point provide consistently excellent breaks. A large National Seashore Parking area provides ample room for surfers, and the wide beach may sometimes be crowded, but when the surf is good, the crowd is most definitely worth it. Many local surfing competitions launch from the Old Lighthouse location, and after a few good sessions, visiting surfers will recognize that the combination of good waves, and consistent conditions, is the main reason why.'

    description: 'The surf at Mulaghmore is a long, fast and hollow left hander which slam onto a ledge of unforgiving reef. High tide and waves of sufficient size are necessary for the waves to break out from the rock. Mullaghmore starts breaking at about 10ft and can hold waves of up to 50ft and beyond. Along with mountainous swells, surfers at this spot also must contend with the rocks, strong currents, and often Baltic conditions of winter on the west of Ireland. This is a wave of consequence, and has broken its fair share of bones and boards.'

To the left, around the headland, is Banana Point and for the experienced surfer a gem lies between the two spots. Can be crowded on the weekends with locals. Relaxed vibe and great cafe on the beach.'

    description: 'Playa de Pared in Fuerteventura is an exposed beach break that usually has waves, although summer tends to be mostly flat. The best wind direction is from the southeast. Waves just as likely from local windswells as from distant groundswells and the ideal swell direction is from the northwest. Waves at the beach break both left and right. Surfable at all stages of the tide. Dangerous rips are a hazard of surfing here.'
